# LWJGLOpenGLSample
An incredibly simple LWJGL sample of openGL in Java designed to help me work with LWJGL openXR bindings to (hopefully) create a few mods for java based games.
Before I could do OpenXR in Java, I first needed a program to convert to openXR to better help me understand the bindings.
This program simply has a moveable camera and a simple shader that uses an MVP matrix.
